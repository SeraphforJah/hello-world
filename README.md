# my identity
My name is Triumph Are.

I'm a uni student about to start his 4th year in Cyber Security.

I've been a bit careless about my priorities over this internship period, but i've decided to change for the better: i've decided to stay focused on my Goal. And i know that my Goal will help me stay focused.

By the way, i like to draw, to write, & to sing. :-)

tA.
